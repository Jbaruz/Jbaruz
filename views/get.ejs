                            <h6><strong>Developing a Remote GET Monitoring Solution During Pandemic Constraints</strong></h6>
                            <p><strong>Situation:</strong> A mining operation with a fleet of 10 cable shovels faced significant challenges in monitoring Ground Engaging Tools (GET) due to strict safety regulations that limited on-site access. Traditionally, inspecting each machine was time-consuming and inefficient, allowing for only zero to three inspections per day. This made it difficult to predict wear and schedule maintenance without disrupting productivity. Initial attempts to gather data remotely included taking photos of GET using zoom cameras from various distances, but these methods were insufficient. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, on-site access was further restricted, exacerbating the inability to monitor GET wear and plan maintenance effectively.</p>
                            <p><strong>Task:</strong> Develop an efficient, effective, and safe method to remotely monitor GET wear and predict maintenance needs during the pandemic, adding value to the customer without requiring on-site presence.</p>
                            <p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Decided to implement a mobile application for operators to use during pre-operational checks, minimizing interactions between operators and mechanics.</li>
                                <li>Convinced the managing director of the project's viability, securing approval with a budget limit of $5,000.</li>
                                <li>Contracted an external development company to create a pilot version of the mobile application within one month.</li>
                                <li>Communicated with the customer to adopt the pilot application for a trial period, focusing on monitoring critical GET components such as specific point positions and identifying worn or damaged tools.</li>
                                <li>Enhanced the application during the trial period based on feedback, leading to a final version after three months.</li>
                                <li>Developed an Excel model using linear regression to predict the lifespan of GET points.</li>
                                <li>Implemented a method to accurately determine the length of GET points from photos within an acceptable error range of 0.25 inches.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The mobile application was successfully adopted by the customer, providing real-time information on GET wear for all eleven cable shovels at least twice daily.</li>
                                <li>Eliminated the need for direct interaction between operators and mechanics regarding GET issues, enhancing safety during the pandemic.</li>

                            <h6><strong>Resolving Frequent Point Breakages on Cable Shovels to Maintain Supplier Relationship</strong></h6>
                            <p><strong>Situation:</strong> A mining customer was experiencing frequent breakages of their cable shovels' GET points, leading to falling points during operation. This issue was significantly affecting the availability and productivity of their fleet of cable shovels. As a result, the customer was considering changing their GET supplier for all 11 of their cable shovels due to these negative impacts.</p>
                            <p><strong>Task:</strong> Develop a solution to address the broken GET points that would meet the customer's expectations and retain the company's position as the GET supplier for the mine.</p>
                            <p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Provided dedicated on-site technical support to work exclusively on resolving the issue.</li>
                                <li>Despite similar issues occurring in the past at another mine, approached this case without assumptions by collecting fresh data and symptoms specific to this situation.</li>
                                <li>Conducted boneyard analyses and fractographic examinations of the broken points to understand the failure mechanisms.</li>
                                <li>Identified variables associated with the breakage events, including point position, digging conditions, machine type, wear condition of adapter noses, measurement data at the time of failure, manufacturing lot numbers, and operator practices.</li>
                                <li>Performed problem analysis using Pareto charts and Ishikawa (fishbone) diagrams to detect patterns and repeated factors contributing to the failures.</li>
                                <li>Conducted finite element analysis focusing on dynamic movements to detect stress effects of impacts on the existing point design and compared it with new design proposals from the engineering team.</li>
                                <li>Prepared and delivered a technical presentation outlining the proposed solution to the customer's management and maintenance teams, aiming to convince them of the effectiveness of the new design.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Results:</strong></p>

                                <li>Successfully convinced the customer to adopt the new updated GET point design, which addressed the negative effects and resolved the breakage issues.</li>
                                <li>Identified patterns where breakage events were more likely to occur, particularly at slope limits with poor blasting and double-bank formations of 30 meters in height, providing valuable insights for operational adjustments.</li>
                                <li>Retained the company's position as the GET supplier for the mine's cable shovels, maintaining the business relationship and customer trust.</li>

                            <h6><strong>Analyzing and Resolving Lip Shroud Breakages on Front-End Loaders</strong></h6>
                            <p><strong>Situation:</strong> A mining operation was experiencing a high number of broken lip shrouds on their front-end loaders (FELs), with 21 incidents reported over a four-month period. The majority of breakages occurred on a specific model of FEL, particularly on one unit that had eight breakages. These failures were causing significant operational challenges and downtime.</p>
                            <p><strong>Task:</strong> Conduct a thorough analysis to determine the root causes of the lip shroud breakages and develop effective solutions to prevent future occurrences.</p>
                            <p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Visited the mining site to inspect the affected FELs, focusing on the unit with the highest number of breakages.</li>
                                <li>Attempted to remove the lip shrouds for inspection but encountered difficulties due to hinge pin obstructions and the accumulation of fine materials (argillic) between the shroud and lip.</li>
                                <li>Observed an excess of 1 mm on the boss within the hinge pin gap, contributing to removal challenges.</li>
                                <li>Noted the presence of fine material trapped between the shroud and lip, which can increase stress and wear.</li>
                                <li>Utilized gauges to measure wear on the front lip but found that incorrect reference points were being used, leading to inaccurate assessments.</li>
                                <li>Corrected the measurement method and determined that there was a 4 mm wear on both the left and right sides of the front lip.</li>
                                <li>Identified that wear in the high-stress areas of the front lip was a primary factor contributing to the shroud breakages.</li>
                                <li>Recognized the need to check wear on the bed lip of the hinge pin, which could also be a contributing factor.</li>
                                <li>Recommended the design and manufacture of a new specialized gauge to accurately measure wear on the lip and hinge pin areas.</li>

                                <li>Successfully identified the root causes of the lip shroud breakages, allowing for targeted corrective actions.</li>
                                <li>Developed a plan to create a new gauge to improve the accuracy of wear measurements, facilitating better maintenance practices.</li>
                                <li>Scheduled follow-up actions to address the lip wear issues using the new gauge, aiming to reduce future breakages and enhance equipment reliability.</li>
                                <li>Met the objectives of the analysis, providing the mining operation with actionable insights and solutions to improve their FEL performance.</li>

                            <h6><strong>Securing GET Supply for New High-Capacity Cable Shovels Amidst Competitor Challenge</strong></h6>
                            <p><strong>Situation:</strong> After our company won a previous competition against a major competitor, a customer intended to equip their three new high-capacity cable shovels (each with a 73 cubic yard capacity, significantly larger than their existing 56 cubic yard shovels) with our Ground Engaging Tools (GET). However, by the time the decision was made, two of the shovels were already in transit fitted with a new competitor's GET system. When the first shovel arrived, the customer decided to conduct a six-month comparative trial between the competitor's GET on that shovel and our GET, to determine which system to adopt for all shovels. These new shovels were critical to the mine's productivity.</p>
                            <p><strong>Task:</strong> At the customer's request, our technical support team was to monitor the performance of the competitor's GET system on the first shovel to ensure that its productivity was not compromised.</p>
                            <p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Inspected the competitor's GET system with a focus on lock-out reliability and overall performance.</li>
                                <li>Monitored key performance indicators such as GET change times, optimal replacement intervals to prevent unplanned downtime, GET lifespan, and safety during GET changes.</li>
                                <li>Ensured maintenance crews followed the competitor's recommended procedures for GET installation and removal.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>After three months of the trial, numerous issues were observed with the competitor's GET, including falling points, loss of penetration efficiency, difficulty removing adapters, and falling shrouds.</li>
                                <li>The customer decided to replace the competitor's GET with our company's GET system on the first shovel.</li>
                                <li>The second shovel, upon arrival at the mine, was immediately fitted with our GET system before commencing operations.</li>
                                <li>Secured our company's position as the GET supplier for all new high-capacity shovels, enhancing the mine's productivity and reinforcing customer trust.</li>

                            <h6><strong>Enhancing Safety and Efficiency in GET Removal with Water Pressure System</strong></h6>
                            <p><strong>Situation:</strong> There was a high risk of accidents caused by metal splinters (3mm particles) detaching from the surface of Ground Engaging Tools (GET) during removal under fine material conditions. This risk was due to the use of hammers on GET to remove fines, despite the tools being designed as hammerless. Additionally, removing and installing GET was difficult and time-consuming because of the fine material, significantly affecting cable shovel productivity. There was also a potential risk of GET falling off during excavation due to improper installation practices, such as inadequate cleaning of fines leading to poor fitting and incorrect torque applied to locking mechanisms.</p>
                            <p><strong>Task:</strong> Develop a safer and more efficient method for GET removal and installation using water pressure, focusing on improving safety and reducing the time required for these processes.</p>
                            <p><strong>Action:</strong></p>

                                <li>Eliminated the use of hammers during GET change work, reducing the risk of metal splinter accidents to zero.</li>
                                <li>Reduced removal time from 1 hour to 15 minutes for each adapter or shroud, and from 1 hour to 20 minutes for nine points.</li>
                                <li>Simplified the GET removal and installation processes.</li>
                                <li>Increased machine availability, leading to higher productivity in areas with fine material.</li>
