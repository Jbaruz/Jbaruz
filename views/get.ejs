                            <h6><strong>Developing a Remote GET Monitoring Solution During Pandemic Constraints</strong></h6>
                            <p><strong>Situation:</strong> A mining operation with a fleet of 10 cable shovels faced significant challenges in monitoring Ground Engaging Tools (GET) due to strict safety regulations that limited on-site access. Traditionally, inspecting each machine was time-consuming and inefficient, allowing for only zero to three inspections per day. This made it difficult to predict wear and schedule maintenance without disrupting productivity. Initial attempts to gather data remotely included taking photos of GET using zoom cameras from various distances, but these methods were insufficient. With the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, on-site access was further restricted, exacerbating the inability to monitor GET wear and plan maintenance effectively.</p>
                            <p><strong>Task:</strong> Develop an efficient, effective, and safe method to remotely monitor GET wear and predict maintenance needs during the pandemic, adding value to the customer without requiring on-site presence.</p>
                            <p><strong>Action:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Decided to implement a mobile application for operators to use during pre-operational checks, minimizing interactions between operators and mechanics.</li>
                                <li>Convinced the managing director of the project's viability, securing approval with a budget limit of $5,000.</li>
                                <li>Contracted an external development company to create a pilot version of the mobile application within one month.</li>
                                <li>Communicated with the customer to adopt the pilot application for a trial period, focusing on monitoring critical GET components such as specific point positions and identifying worn or damaged tools.</li>
                                <li>Enhanced the application during the trial period based on feedback, leading to a final version after three months.</li>
                                <li>Developed an Excel model using linear regression to predict the lifespan of GET points.</li>
                                <li>Implemented a method to accurately determine the length of GET points from photos within an acceptable error range of 0.25 inches.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Results:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The mobile application was successfully adopted by the customer, providing real-time information on GET wear for all eleven cable shovels at least twice daily.</li>
                                <li>Eliminated the need for direct interaction between operators and mechanics regarding GET issues, enhancing safety during the pandemic.</li>
                                <li>Optimized resource utilization by enabling remote monitoring when mechanics could not be present on-site.</li>
                                <li>Achieved accurate prediction of GET change intervals, with an error margin of only 0.25 inches on the length of points.</li>
                                <li>The application received a customer award for Digital Transformation in 2020.</li>
                                <li>Completed the project within the budget, not exceeding the allocated $5,000.</li>
                                <li>The success of the application in controlling GET wear on ten cable shovels helped convince the customer to switch an additional shovel to our products, increasing the total to eleven shovels by the end of 2020.</li>

                            <p><strong>Situation:</strong> There was a high risk of accidents caused by metal splinters (3mm particles) detaching from the surface of Ground Engaging Tools (GET) during removal under fine material conditions. This risk was due to the use of hammers on GET to remove fines, despite the tools being designed as hammerless. Additionally, removing and installing GET was difficult and time-consuming because of the fine material, significantly affecting cable shovel productivity. There was also a potential risk of GET falling off during excavation due to improper installation practices, such as inadequate cleaning of fines leading to poor fitting and incorrect torque applied to locking mechanisms.</p>
